This code implements a database and interface for a vaccination tracking system. It allows creating and populating database tables for users, vaccines, vaccinations, side effects, and linking tables. The interface defines methods to perform various queries on the data such as:

- Finding vaccines not yet given to any user
- Listing users vaccinated with 2+ doses after a certain date
- Finding recent vaccines without "vac" in the name
- Listing users with 2+ doses and 1 or fewer side effects
- Finding users vaccinated with all vaccines causing a side effect
- Listing users vaccinated with 2+ vaccine types in a date range
- Getting side effects for users with doses close together
- Calculating average doses for elderly users
- Updating user eligibility after time since last dose
- Deleting vaccines by name
The implementation handles connecting to the database and provides SQL queries to perform the required operations on the tables. This allows abstracting the database operations behind a simple interface to facilitate developing vaccination tracking features in a modular way.
