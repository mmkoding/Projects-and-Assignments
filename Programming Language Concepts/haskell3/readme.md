This code implements functions to analyze ant colony nest structures represented as tree data structures. Key functions include:

- nestNutritionValue - calculates total nutrition value of a nest
- pathNutritionValues - gets nutrition values for all root-to-leaf paths
- shallowestTunnel - finds depth of shallowest tunnel if any
- pathToQueen - gets path to the Queen's Chambers if present
- quickQueenDepth - calculates shortest path length to Queen's Chambers using tunnels

It includes example nest data structures to test the functions.
