This Haskell code processes a robot's path and field dimensions to determine navigation statistics. Key functions:

- getVector - converts direction string to vector
- getAllVectors - generates all vector moves from a list of directions
- producePath - produces complete path from starting point and directions
- takePathInArea - filters path to stay within given dimensions
- remainingObjects - determines objects not visited by the path
- averageStepsInSuccess - calculates average path length for successful tries
