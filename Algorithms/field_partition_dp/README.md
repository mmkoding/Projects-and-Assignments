## Field Partition
This code implements and compares three solutions to find the minimum cost of partitioning a given W x L field with vertical and horizontal cuts - recursive, memoization, and bottom-up dynamic programming. It defines helper functions for each approach and finds the minimum cost using all three given a 2D boolean array indicating partition locations.
