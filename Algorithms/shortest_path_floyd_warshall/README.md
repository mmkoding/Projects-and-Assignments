This code finds the shortest path between two nodes s and d passing through intermediate nodes x and y in a weighted directed graph. It implements Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs. Then it constructs the overall shortest s-d path by combining shortest s-x, x-y, and y-d paths.
