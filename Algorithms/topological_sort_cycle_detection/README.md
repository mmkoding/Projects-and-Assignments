This code detects cycles and finds a topological ordering in a directed graph representing a race between N participants. It takes a vector of edge updates as input. It implements DFS to find any cycles. If no cycle, Kahn's algorithm is used to generate the topological ordering of participants. Otherwise, the cycle is returned as the ordering.
