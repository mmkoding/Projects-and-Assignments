This C++ code implements the IDA* search algorithm to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve a sliding puzzle.

The key aspects are:

- It takes a permutation of numbers as input representing the puzzle state
- Two heuristics are defined to estimate the remaining moves - one for small puzzles (size <= 12) and one for larger puzzles
- The IDA* search is implemented with recursive depth-first search
- At each level, all possible swap moves are tried and the ones leading to better solutions are kept
- The best solution is printed out as a sequence of swap moves
- Helper functions are provided for swapping elements, counting lines, checking if goal is reached etc.
- The main loop increases the search bound until a solution is found
- The number of moves and the full sequence of moves is printed out

So in summary, it implements the IDA* algorithm to efficiently search for and print the optimal move sequence to solve a sliding puzzle given an initial state.
