This C++ code uses the IDA* algorithm to find the optimal solution to a sliding block puzzle given an initial state.

The key aspects are:

- It takes a permutation of numbers as input representing the initial puzzle layout
- A heuristic function estimates the number of moves remaining based on block positions
- IDA* search is implemented recursively with increasing depth bounds
- At each level, all possible cyclic shift moves are tried and ones leading to better solutions are kept
- The best sequence of moves is stored when a solution is found
- Main loop increases depth bound until solution is found
- The number of moves and sequence of moves (start, end, shift size) is printed

So in summary, it uses iterative deepening and the IDA* approach to efficiently find and print the shortest sequence of cyclic shift moves to solve the sliding block puzzle.

The main techniques used are heuristic search, recursive depth-first traversal, and iterative deepening to avoid exponential complexity.
