This C++ code calculates the number of ways to tile a given rectangular grid using 1x1, 1x2 and 2x1 tiles with at most D 2x1 tiles.

The key aspects are:

- It uses dynamic programming to build up solutions
- A 3D array stores the number of ways for each tile size, width and max 2x1 tiles
- It calculates the ways for each width and max 2x1 tiles based on smaller subproblems
- Results are stored modulo a constant to avoid overflow
- Helper function is used to do modular addition
- The final way count is computed by looping through the array
- Main function gets input dimensions and max 2x1 tiles, calls calculation routine and prints the number of ways

So in summary, it efficiently calculates the number of ways to tile a grid using modular arithmetic and building up an array of results for subproblems.
