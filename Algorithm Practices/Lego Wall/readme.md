This C++ code calculates the number of ways to tile a given rectangular grid with 1x2 lego blocks.

The key aspects are:

- It precomputes number of ways to tile sizes upto 100,000 using dynamic programming
- Given a W x H grid, it calculates ways to tile strips of width 1 to W using precomputed values
- It uses inclusion-exclusion principle to get ways for full grid by excluding overcounted ways from strip totals
- Results are stored modulo a large prime to avoid overflow
- Power function is used to exponentiate precomputed values to tile multiple rows
- Main function gets input dimensions, calls the calculation routine and prints number of ways

So in summary, it efficiently calculates the number of lego block tiling arrangements for a large grid using precomputation, dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.
