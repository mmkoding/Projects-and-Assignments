This C++ code determines the normalized ranks of students based on their scores in two subjects using a Fenwick tree.

The key aspects are:

Students have scores a and b, id and rank
Students are sorted by a descending, and ties broken by b descending
A Fenwick tree tracks cumulative counts for each unique b score
Students are processed in sorted order
Rank is students index minus Fenwick tree count for scores < current student's b
This gives rank normalized relative to students with lower b scores
Final ranks are printed out for each student id
Fenwick tree allows query and update of cumulative counts in a range
Avoids reprocessing all students for each one to calculate normalized ranks

So in summary, it uses a Fenwick tree to efficiently calculate normalized ranks in a 2D scoring system by reducing the problem to 1D cumulative counts.

The overall approach is to sort students by the primary score, and use the Fenwick tree to incrementally track ranks based on the secondary score.
