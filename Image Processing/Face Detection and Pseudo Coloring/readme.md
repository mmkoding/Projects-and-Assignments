This code implements a variety of image processing and computer vision techniques on a set of input images. It has functions for:

- Face detection - Using skin tone thresholding and morphological operations to detect faces in images
- Pseudo-coloring - Mapping grayscale images to color using a provided color map
- Splitting images into HSI color channels - Separating hue, saturation, intensity channels
- Edge detection - Applying Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt filters on images to find edges, in both RGB and HSI color spaces
- Other techniques like contrast enhancement, merging HSI channels, marking detected faces

The main workflow is:

1-Detect faces in a few input images with different contrast levels
2-Pseudo-color some grayscale input images using provided color maps
3-Split pseudo-colored images into HSI channels and merge them back
4-Run various edge detection filters on input images in RGB and HSI modes
5-Use contrast enhancement, morphological ops for processing

It takes a folder of input images, applies the implemented techniques, and saves the output images to demonstrate the results. The code provides reusable functions for common image manipulation tasks.
